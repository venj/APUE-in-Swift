APUE in Swift
=============

**WIP**

I think learn Swift cross-platform programming by APUE book (Advanced Programming in Unix Environment) would be a lot of fun. 

So this repo is my attempt to go through the book using Swift.

Platform
========

Code examples may be stand-alone Swift file, Swift Package Manager project, Xcode command line project or sometimes Xcode Playground. If any of the example is not Linux compatible, it would be, soon.
