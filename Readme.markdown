APUE in Swift
=============

**WIP**

I think learn Swift cross-platform programming by APUE book (Advanced Programming in Unix Environment) would be a lot of fun. 

So this repo is my attempt to go through the book using Swift.

Platform
========

Code examples uses standard alone Swift source code, Xcode command line project template or sometimes Xcode Playground, but I will add Linux support later, wherever possible.
